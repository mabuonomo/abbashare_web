# About

Because of the changes in the ([EU Cookie Law](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm)), the website operators must inform the visitors about the site's use of cookies.

This simple script is free of dependencies, does not require use of framework. The minimalized version is less than 5 Kb. The Cookie bar gives the opportunity for the guest to know about active cookie usage.
