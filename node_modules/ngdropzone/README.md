AngularJS directive for __[dropzone](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone)__

#### UPDATE
In latest release **v1.0.5**, distribution files have been renamed to match newly changed package name. Please **rename urls** to distribution files if you are updating this package. Also, **gulp** and **sass** support have been added. 

***

## 1. Getting started

### â†’ Install using npm
```
npm install ngdropzone
```

### â†’ Install using bower
Run following command in your working directory using shell/cmd
```
bower install ngdropzone
```

1. Include `angular.js` and `dropzone.js`, `dropzone.css` from bower_components.
2. Include `ng-dropzone.min.js` from `dist` folder of `ng-dropzone` package inside bower_component.
3. You can also include `ng-dropzone.min.css` but it's not necessary. I have **overridden** some **ugly looking** css from `dropzone.css`

### â†’ Install manually
##### Step 1
You must have AngularJS library included for this directive to work : [Download from Google CDN](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#angularjs)

##### Step 2
You need to download `dropzone.js` and `dropzone.css` files from dropzone repository : [Get from official release](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

##### Step 3
Download `ng-dropzone.min.js` from this [official release](https://github.com/thatisuday/ng-dropzone/releases)

##### Step 4
Include above files in `<head></head>` section of your html page

----------

## 2. Create .js file and set _Dropzone.autoDiscover_ to _false_
```
//Add below line at the top of your JavaScript code
Dropzone.autoDiscover = false;
//This will prevent Dropzone to instantiate on it's own unless you are using dropzone class for styling
```

***

## 3. Configure your angular app
Include `thatisuday.dropzone` module inside your angular app.
```
var myNgApp = angular.module('myAppName', ['thatisuday.dropzone']);
```

####â›¹Optional
> You can configure dropzone before an app starts running. ng-dropzone comes with built in **dropzoneOps** provider to configure [dropzone options](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration-options) which can be implemented as below. _setOptions_ function will set default options fot all your dropzone instances in that app.

```
myNgApp.config(function(dropzoneOpsProvider){
	dropzoneOpsProvider.setOptions({
		url : '/upload_url',
		maxFilesize : '10',
		...
	});
});
```

####â›¹Optional
>You can also add default options in **dropzoneOps** provider `(ng-dropzone.min.js)` inside `defOps` object. This is very helpful in case you have multiple apps.  **_But it is not recommended because if you upgrade this directive in future, your app might not behave the way it should._**

***

## 4. Create dropzone(s)
You can create dropzone using `ng-dropzone` attribute or `<ng-dropzone></ng-dropzone>` element.
```
<div class="dropzone" options="dzOptions" callbacks="dzCallbacks" methods="dzMethods" ng-dropzone></div>
```
**_OR_**
```
<ng-dropzone class="dropzone" options="dzOptions" callbacks="dzCallbacks" methods="dzMethods"></ng-dropzone>
```
> **options** attribute specifies model that will set [options (click to see)](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration-options) for dropzone and will override any options that may have been provided with **dropzoneOps** provider. For example, `$scope.dzOptions = {bla:bleh,...};`

> **callbacks** attribute specifies model that will handle [events (click to see)](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#events) for dropzone. For example, `$scope.dzCallbacks.addedfile = function(file){//do something};`

> **methods** attribute specifies model that will set [methods (click to see)](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#dropzone-methods) for dropzone. For example, `$scope.dzMethods.removeFile(file);` or `<button ng-click="dzMethods.removeAllFiles();">...</button>`

As per above example, **_dzOptions_** is model that set options for dropzone, **_dzCallbacks_** is model that handles events for dropzone while **_dzMethods_** is _gateway_ model that triggers dropzone methods.

***

## 5. Configure dropzone(s)
**callbacks** are not necessary for your dropzone to work, these are just events that you may need as a callback for certain activities of your dropzone. But **options** must be given inside your controller _unless you are configuring it from **dropzoneOps** provider_. _url_ field in dropzone options is mandatory.

```
myNgApp.controller('main', function($scope){
	//Set options for dropzone
	//Visit http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration-options for more options
	$scope.dzOptions = {
		url : '/alt_upload_url',
		paramName : 'photo',
		maxFilesize : '10',
		acceptedFiles : 'image/jpeg, images/jpg, image/png',
		addRemoveLinks : true,
		...
	};
	
	
	//Handle events for dropzone
	//Visit http://www.dropzonejs.com/#events for more events
	$scope.dzCallbacks = {
		'addedfile' : function(file){
			console.log(file);
			$scope.newFile = file;
		},
		'success' : function(file, xhr){
			console.log(file, xhr);
		},
		...
	};
	
	
	//Apply methods for dropzone
	//Visit http://www.dropzonejs.com/#dropzone-methods for more methods
	$scope.dzMethods = {};
	$scope.removeNewFile = function(){
		$scope.dzMethods.removeFile($scope.newFile); //We got $scope.newFile from 'addedfile' event callback
	}
});
```

By default, dropzone starts file upload when file is dropped or added to the list. But this can be prevented using `autoProcessQueue:false` in options. Then you have to manually start file upload using **_dzMethods_** model. You just have to call function `dzMethods.processQueue();` to start upload.

> For better understanding, **__âš‘__**  checkout source code in /test/test.html file or visit second example in  [preview](https://rawgit.com/thatisuday/ng-dropzone/master/demo/main.html) of this directive.

> I have added two more extra methods `getDropzone` and `getAllFiles` which returns **dropzone instance** and **dropzone files** respectively. These methods do not accept any _arguments_ and only work with _ng-dropzone_.

> If `$scope.dzMethods.method` throws _undefined_ error, wrap it in `$timeout(function(){...})`. This happens because you are referencing an object that is empty as dropzone is not yet property linked with the controller scope.
