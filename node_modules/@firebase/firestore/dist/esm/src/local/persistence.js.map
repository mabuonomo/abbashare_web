All read / write operations must be wrapped in a\n * transaction. Implementations of PersistenceTransaction / Persistence only\n * need to guarantee that writes made against the transaction are not made to\n * durable storage until the transaction resolves its PersistencePromise.\n * Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are\n * free to ignore the transaction.\n *\n * This contract is enough to allow the LocalStore be be written\n * independently of whether or not the stored state actually is durably\n * persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are grouped together to\n * avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.\n *\n * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of\n * MutationQueue, RemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will\n * defer their writes into a transaction. Once the local store has completed\n * one logical operation, it commits the transaction.\n *\n * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the\n * mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because\n * memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.\n *\n * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only\n * implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any\n * special dual-store implementation of Persistence. The cost is that the\n * LocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order of its reads and\n * writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted\n * writes.\n */\nexport interface Persistence {\n  /**\n   * Starts persistent storage, opening the database or similar.\n   *\n   * Throws an exception if the database could not be opened.\n   */\n  start(): Promise<void>;\n\n  /** Releases any resources held during eager shutdown. */\n  shutdown(): Promise<void>;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns a MutationQueue representing the persisted mutations for the\n   * given user.\n   *\n   * Note: The implementation is free to return the same instance every time\n   * this is called for a given user.
