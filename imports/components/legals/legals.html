                            Thanks for using abbashare! These terms of service (&quot;Terms&quot;) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites (&quot;Services&quot;).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions</h2>
                        <p>
                            When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email messages, contacts and so on (&quot;Your Stuff&quot;). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable
                            us to offer the Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews, email organisation, easy sorting, editing, sharing and
                            searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Sharing Your Stuff</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
                        <p>
                            You're responsible for your conduct, Your Stuff and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share content unless you have
                            the right to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. That said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don't have access to it, and keep your account information current.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13.

                        <h2>Software</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some of our Services allow you to download client software (&quot;Software&quot;) which may be updated automatically. As long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the Software,
                            solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source licence, we'll make that licence available to you and the provisions of that licence may expressly override some
                            of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Our Stuff</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Services are protected by copyright, trademark and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don't grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others' content in the Services, abbashare trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome
                            feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Copyright</h2>
                        <p>
                            We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete
                            or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
                        <p>
                            <em>Billing</em>. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a &quot;Paid Account&quot;). We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and
                            on each periodic renewal until cancellation. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>No Refunds</em>. You may cancel your abbashare Paid Account at any time but you won't be issued a refund unless it's legally required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Downgrades</em>. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to
                            free space levels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Changes</em>. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Termination</h2>
                        <p>
                            You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you're not complying with
                            these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use of the Services. Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account
                            if you haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We'll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Services &quot;AS IS&quot;</h2>
                        <p>
                            We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, abbashare AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.
                            THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may
                            not apply to you.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                        <p>
                            TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR ANY LIABILITY FOR abbashare’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, IN NO EVENT WILL abbashare, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (B) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            THIS WILL BE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT abbashare OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ADDITIONALLY, abbashare, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO abbashare FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE

                            Some places don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
                        <p>
                            <em>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First</em>. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against abbashare, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@abbashare.com.
                            We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or abbashare may bring a formal proceeding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Judicial forum for disputes</em>. You and abbashare agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California,
                            subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and abbashare consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
                        </p>

                        <h2>IF YOU’RE A US RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h2>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                            <em>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</em>. You and abbashare agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate
                            below.

                            <em>Arbitration Procedures</em>. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration
                            will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA) or any other location we agree to.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                            <em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives</em>. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. abbashare will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favourable
                            than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. abbashare will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                            <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. Either you or abbashare may assert claims, if they qualify, in a small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring
                            a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorised use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration
                            or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco
                            County, California to resolve your claim.

                        <h2>Controlling Law</h2>
                        <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
                        <p>
                            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and abbashare with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter
                            of these Terms. These Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h2>
                        <p>
                            abbashare's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our
                            intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. abbashare may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest
                            of any business associated with the Services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your
                            account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

                        <h2>What &amp; Why</h2>

                        <p>
                            <em>Account</em>. We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information

                            you give us access to your contacts, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use. This will make it easy for you to do things like share your stuff, send emails and invite others to use the Services.
                        </p>
